<h2>Welcome!</h2>

<img src="/images/haskell-logo.png" style="float: right; margin: 20px;" />

<p>We are a worm-out team of IT-specialists bound together by things which
  constitute our essence and shape:
<ul>
  <li>we are technology-infatuated and believe that even boring tasks
      deserve elegant and robust solutions. This is why we use Haskell
      as our primary language to do our job;</li>
  <li>we are industry-oriented people, so tangible results is definitely
      among our values;</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>We are always open to discuss your ideas, projects or tasks. In the case
   they are on our street, we would be more than happy to work together.
   Please give us a shout on <a href="https://t.me/euonymenian">Telegram<a/>.
